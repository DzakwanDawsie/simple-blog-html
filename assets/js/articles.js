To prove their value to the other Knights, Linel and Fizel carry the immobilized Kirito and Eugeo all the way to the 50th floor, where Fanatio, vice-commander of the Integrity Knights, awaits them. Upon arriving there, Kirito, revealing that he saw through their scheme and had taken measures to protect himself, uses the same daggers to restrain them, and confronts Fanatio alone until Eugeo recovers. Eugeo then uses his \"Perfect Weapon Control Arts\" to immobilize the knights.",

Dual-wielding, Kirito loses his right arm but cuts off Administrator's remaining arm and deals critical damage. Administrator decides to exit the Underworld and summons the system console, but Chudelkin suddenly regains consciousness and latches on to Administrator, begging her to not leave him.

      "content": "A few months have passed since the fall of Administrator. After the events of the first season, the energy surge in the Ocean Turtle has damaged Kirito's Fluctlight, causing him to become catatonic, barely reacting to outside stimuli. Fearing for Kirito's safety and life, as he is known to be one of the individuals who defeated Administrator, Alice has taken him back to Rulid Village by riding Amayori, her dragon companion. Alice has since built a log cabin and settled in with Kirito outside of Rulid, where she looks after him every day. Because she is still deemed a criminal, she is not allowed to live within the village. Despite this, she is regularly visited by Selka, her younger sister, and frequently employed to cut down particularly tough trees by Barbossa, a self-centered landowner who, along with his tree cutters, looks down on Alice.",

Far to the south, Bercouli Synthesis One pursues Vector on dragonback, and uses his secret skill, Uragiri, to ground Vector's dragon.",

With the help of Eugeo's spirit, Kirito defeats Miller for good just as the UW server reaches maximum acceleration, which forcibly logs out all other players from UW while Alice also departs to the real world through the altar. Realizing that he will be trapped inside UW for 200 years, Kirito bursts into tears until Asuna appears before him, much to his surprise.",
